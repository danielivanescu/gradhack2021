## Sample APEX application to monitor air polution
* author: Daniel Ivanescu

## Prerequistes
### Rest API
* the same application uses the Air pollution rest api from openweathermap.org
* to use this api you must sign up for an api key https://openweathermap.org/api/air-pollution
### Oracle APEX
* You will need an Oracle APEX workspace to deploy the application.
* More details on https://apex.oracle.com/en/learn/getting-started/
* I recommend signing up for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure free tier or a trial account.
* Attendees at Gradhack can use the provided trial accounts

## Sample application
* f106.sql - you will need to edit App 106 > Shared Components > Web credentials with your own api key.
## Sample data model script supporting the sample application
* sample_ddl.sql - sample app will give errors without these tables in place.


*I suggest you use the sample datasheet and guides below to build your own version

## Sample data spreadsheet
* production_sites.csv
