* author: Daniel Ivanescu

## Prerequistes
### Rest API
* the same application uses the Air pollution rest api from openweathermap.org
* to use this api you must sign up for an api key https://openweathermap.org/api/air-pollution
### Oracle APEX
* You will need an Oracle APEX workspace to deploy the application.
* More details on https://apex.oracle.com/en/learn/getting-started/
* I recommend signing up for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure free tier or a trial account.
